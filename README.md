Scratchpads Chef Repository
===========================
This repository contains all of the scripts and settings required to setup an 
instance of a Scratchpads server network. The network will consist of a load 
balancer, 1 or many application servers, 1 or many database servers, and a 
search server. We intend to use this repository to manage the Scratchpads 
instance at the Natural History Museum, London, and have therefore included 
passwords in encrypted data bags. If maintaining the servers at the museum, 
please contact Simon Rycroft, or Vince Smith for the encryption key.

Further documentation is available in the [documentation](documentation) folder.
