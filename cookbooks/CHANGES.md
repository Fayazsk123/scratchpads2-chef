List of changes made to standard cookbooks
==========================================

mmonit
------
This cookbook is a fork of https://github.com/allaire/chef-mmonit. A pull 
request should be submitted so that some of the changes are submitted back to 
the original project.

Percona
-------
There is a minor tweak to this cookbook (last commit) which removes the 
debugging/logging for a specific part of the cookbook. I am not sure why I have 
done this, but am confident that it was done for a reason (possibly related to 
chef compatibility).
