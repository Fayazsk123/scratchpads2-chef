Services we depend on
=====================

Strictly speaking, there are no services we depend upon, although there are 
services we use for specific features on the Scratchpads. We no longer rely on 
EoL for providing classifications for import into a Scratchpad, and instead 
have a local copy of the Catalogue of Life which provides CSV files for import 
(a future development task may be to convert this so that imports are done 
using direct database connections). The services we still use are:

EoL
---

The Encyclopedia of Life provides additional data on taxon pages. This feature 
is optional and is disabled by default on new Scratchpads.

GBIF
----

Provide a basic overlay map on species page maps. This feature is optional, but 
I believe it is enabled by default on new Scratchpads.

WoRMS
-----

Provides a basic classification import. This feature is optional and is 
disabled by default on new Scratchpads.

BHL
---

Provides a basic widget on taxon pages that shows related literature from BHL. 
This feature is optional and is disabled by default on new Scratchpads.

IUCN
----

Provides a basic widget on taxon pages that shows related information from the 
IUCN. This feature is optional and is disabled by default on new Scratchpads.

NCBI
----

Provides a basic widget on taxon pages that shows related information from the 
NCBI. This feature is optional and is disabled by default on new Scratchpads.

ReFindit Widget/Refindit Import
-------------------------------

The widget provides a basic block on taxon pages that shows related literature 
from ReFindit. The importer allows for the importing of a bibliographic 
reference by providing just an author name and year.
